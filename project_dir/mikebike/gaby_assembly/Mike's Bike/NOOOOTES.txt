holes to be smaller ~0.5mm tha n colins and longer dips behind them

i have suspicion that  his screws are kind short 

the nose can be a bit more high

the box has to be 
*cut corners
*wide as possible all the way up to the peddles
*hole has to be round

he wants to put cables on the side and have cable comming in through the hole and connecting with them inside on the side ... 

the triangle has to have cable hole at the top back right corner

1cm by 1cm
hole 0.5cm by 3cm
